# AstroRun
AstroRun is an indie game developed by a small team of three people. It's about a lost adventurer in space, who must complete various levels that are all part of a diverse collection of worlds. Each world is based around a certain theme and has its own unique intractable objects such as trampolines, falling spikes, enemies, turrets and much more. Along the way, the adventurer can collect various items which can be used to purchase new packages and accessories.
